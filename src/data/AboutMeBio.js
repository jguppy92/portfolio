      My journey into coding started when I was 16 and studying for my A-Levels. I picked up some Visual Basic and Pascal during an IT class and immediately fell in love with building small applications and problem solving.<br/>
      <br/>

      Whilst my working knowledge of those two languages has sadly been lost to time, my passion has not. After spending four years studying a degree in Japanese and Korean, and almost two years working in marketing, I felt the itch to flex my brain again by returning to coding.<br/>
      <br/>

      Having finished a three month intensive Software Engineering Course with General Assembly, I am now on the lookout to join a friendly, dynamic and forward-thinking team in order to grow and develop further as an engineer. I feel most at home on the MERN stack but I am keen to get stuck into other technologies, too!

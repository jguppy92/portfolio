      My journey into coding started at 16 years of age while I was studying for my A-Levels. I began to pick up some Visual Basic and Pascal during an IT class I was taking and immediately fell in love with building small applications and problem solving.<br/>
      <br/>

      Whilst my working knowledge of those two languages has sadly been lost to time, my passion on the other hand has not. After spending four years studying a degree in Japanese and Korean, and almost two years working in marketing, I began to feel the itch to flex my brain again.<br/>
      <br/>

      Having finished a three month intensive Software Engineering Course with General Assembly I am now on the lookout to join a friendly, dynamic and forward-thinking team in order to grow and develop further. I feel most at home on the MERN stack but always relish the opportunity to get my teeth into new technologies too!

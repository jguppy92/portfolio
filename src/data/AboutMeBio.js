      My journey into coding started when I was 16 and studying for my A-Levels. I picked up some Visual Basic and Pascal during an IT class and immediately fell in love with building simple applications and problem solving.<br/>
      <br/>


      After spending four years studying a degree in Japanese and Korean at SOAS, University of London, and two years working in a marketing role in the video game industry, I felt the itch to flex my brain again and return to coding.<br/>
      <br/>


      Having over two years of full stack web development experience in the affiliate marketing industry, I was able to solidify a range of technical and personal skills. During this time I built a range of projects using various frontend and backend technologies. I feel most at home using MERN technologies and building RESTful and GraphQL APIs in Django. On top of this I also have some experience coding in Ruby which Iâ€™d love an opportunity to develop further.<br/>

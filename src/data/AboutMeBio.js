      My journey into software development started in school when I picked up some Visual Basic and Pascal during an IT class and immediately fell in love with building simple applications and problem solving.<br/>
      <br/>

      After spending four years studying a degree in Japanese and Korean at SOAS, University of London, and two years working in the video game industry, I felt the itch to flex my brain again and return to coding.<br/>
      <br/>

      Throughout my time working as a developer I have built a range of projects from browser extension support tools to custom affiliate tracking solutions and CRUD APIs. Iâ€™m proficient at building RESTful and GraphQL backends in technologies such as Django and Express.js, as well using popular frontend frameworks like React.js.<br/>

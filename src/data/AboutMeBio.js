      My journey into coding started when I was 16 and studying for my A-Levels. I picked up some Visual Basic and Pascal during an IT class and immediately fell in love with building small applications and problem solving.<br/>
      <br/>


      Whilst my working knowledge of those two languages has sadly been lost to time, my passion has not. After spending four years studying a degree in Japanese and Korean, and almost two years working in marketing, I felt the itch to flex my brain again by returning to coding.<br/>
      <br/>


      Having finished a three month intensive Software Engineering Course with General Assembly, I was able to solidify my fullstack web development skills. During this time I built a range of projects using various frontend and backend technologies. I feel most at home on the MERN stack, but Iâ€™m also proficient at building REST and GraphQL APIs using Django and have some experience with Ruby.<br/>
